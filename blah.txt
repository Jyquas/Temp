We're developing a booking system that's tailored for adaptability, aligning seamlessly with your team's operational needs. Central to this system are your team's Full-Time Equivalents (FTEs) and their efficiency in processing transactions.

Here's the essence of it: each transaction is allocated a processing time of approximately 15 minutes. This means that with a single FTE, the capability is set at handling one transaction per each 15-minute interval.

A key feature of this system is its configurability. As your team expands or enhances their transaction processing speed, the system can adapt to these changes. It's engineered to scale with your team's growth, enabling a higher volume of simultaneous transactions as your workforce expands or becomes more efficient.

Beyond transaction processing, the system facilitates the creation of new transactions by users. They will have access to a calendar interface to select from available timeslots, populated based on the system's current data. Initially, the system will launch without communication features, but this is an aspect we are open to including in subsequent versions.

Upon a user confirming a timeslot, it becomes reserved for their use. Detailed aspects such as the drafting process will be elaborated on in later stages of development.

For your internal team, the system includes a distinct interface. This interface will allow them to monitor timeslot allocations and see who has reserved each slot. While the capability for the internal team to modify or reassign timeslots is not included in the initial release, we are considering incorporating this functionality in future updates for enhanced management and control.
