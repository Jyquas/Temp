M365 Deployment Strategy: Clarifying Our Approach and Focus Areas
As we progress with our Microsoft 365 (M365) ecosystem deployment, it's essential to delineate our team's direct responsibilities, identify where stringent quality control is necessary, highlight areas still requiring detailed planning, and acknowledge processes that, while initially flexible, will need refinement.

Direct Responsibilities:

Information Hubs Setup: We are tasked with the foundational setup of Information Hubs as defined in our proof of concept (POC). This phase involves establishing the structural framework for each hub, ensuring they're primed for content addition and future enhancements.

Applying Themes and Layouts: A critical early step is the implementation of selected themes and homepage layouts for each Information Hub, aimed at ensuring consistency and a user-friendly interface throughout our M365 deployment.

Quality Control Focus:

Content Type Development and Validation: The content types devised during the POC phase were intended to showcase the potential for improved search functionality and content distribution. However, created in a POC context, they lack the backing of comprehensive business requirements, rendering them not yet suitable for production. The development of these content types is crucial for organizing and managing documents effectively across the ecosystem. Therefore, each content type will undergo thorough testing against operational, compliance, and user experience standards before its production deployment.
Areas Requiring Further Definition:

Approval Workflows for Content Creation: We need to establish clear guidelines and processes for content approval within Information Hubs. This includes defining how news distribution and specific functions, tentatively labeled "ASDF," will be executed. It's also necessary to identify requirements that cannot be fulfilled by out-of-the-box (OOTB) features to ensure a path forward for customization or third-party solutions.
Processes to Be Refined Over Time:

Site Creation and Integration Flexibility: Initially, the process for creating new sites and integrating them into Information Hubs will be approached with flexibility. Recognizing the importance of this process's evolution, we anticipate developing a more structured approach that aligns with our organization's standards and governance models over time.
In summary, our team is poised to effectively carry out the agreed components of the M365 deployment, with an acute awareness of areas needing focused attention. We're committed to implementing rigorous quality control for critical elements such as content type creation and are prepared to address and refine processes that are vital for the long-term success and governance within our M365 ecosystem. This balanced strategy ensures we advance with confidence, laying a strong foundation for our organization's digital transformation.
