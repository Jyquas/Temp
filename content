M365 Deployment Strategy: Team Commitments and Quality Control

As we refine our approach to deploying our M365 ecosystem, it's crucial to clarify what my team is prepared to handle directly, what requires stringent quality control, what still needs clear requirements, and which processes we can initially adopt with the intention of maturing them over time.

What My Team Will Handle:

Agreed Information Hubs: We're set to configure and roll out the agreed-upon Information Hubs, applying designated themes to each to ensure a consistent and engaging user experience across the board. This includes setting up the home page layouts and other structural elements, all modeled off the existing proof of concept (POC). It's important to note that these hubs will be structured containers at this stage, without any actual content.

Themes and Layouts: The application of themes and the arrangement of home page layouts for each Information Hub have been agreed upon. This foundational work is crucial for establishing a visually cohesive and user-friendly environment across our M365 ecosystem.

Where Quality Control is Essential:

Content Type Creation: The development of new content types is a delicate process, given their significant impact on document management and user experience across the ecosystem. Each content type will undergo thorough testing and must be accepted before being moved into production. This ensures that all content types are fully functional, meet user needs, and comply with our governance standards.
Areas Requiring Defined Requirements:

Approval Processes for Information Hubs: Specific guidelines and approval processes for content creation within Information Hubs still need to be established. This includes how news dissemination and "ASDF" functions will be managed. Additionally, we need to outline all requirements that cannot be met via out-of-the-box (OOTB) features, ensuring we have a clear path forward for custom development or third-party solutions.
Processes to Mature Over Time:

Creation and Integration of New Sites: While we understand the importance of a robust process for creating new sites and integrating them into the appropriate Information Hub, we acknowledge that this process can initially adopt a more flexible approach. However, it is on our radar to develop and refine this process to ensure it becomes more structured and governed over time, aligning with our broader organizational standards and governance policies.
In summary, our team is fully committed to executing the agreed-upon aspects of the M365 deployment, with a clear understanding of where our focus needs to be. We recognize the importance of rigorous quality control for critical elements such as content type creation and are prepared to define and refine processes that are crucial for long-term success and governance within our M365 ecosystem. This balanced approach allows us to move forward effectively while laying the groundwork for continuous improvement and maturation of our processes.
